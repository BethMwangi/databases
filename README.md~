**provide back-up and recovery**
**Control redundancy**
**Allow data independence**

###Classifcations 
####Relational databases
relational database  treats all data as a collection of related data. It has attributes like minimum redundancy, referential integrity, database keys.
The ACID model (guarantee of successful transactions):
– Atomicity (all or nothing rule)
– Consistency (only valid data in)
– Isolation (order of executed transactions)
– Durability (committed transaction will not be lost)

##SQL (Structured Query Language)

+It is the standard language for Relation Dtabase system. relational management system include MySQL,Sybase, Ms Access, Oracle, Informax. 

###Why Use SQL?

 * Allows users to describe the data
 * Allows to embed within other langauges using SQL modules, libraries & pre-compilers.
